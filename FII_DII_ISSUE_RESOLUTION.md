# FII/DII Data Fetching Issue - Resolution

## 🔍 Issues Found

### Issue 1: Date Comparison Using Local Time Instead of UTC
**Location:** `data_fetchers.py` line 641

**Problem:**
```python
# OLD CODE (WRONG)
today = datetime.now().strftime('%d-%b-%Y')  # Uses local time
```

- GitHub Actions runs in **UTC timezone**
- The app was comparing with **local system time**
- Date mismatch caused the app to reject the JSON file data

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# NEW CODE (FIXED)
today = datetime.utcnow().strftime('%d-%b-%Y')  # Uses UTC time
```

### Issue 2: Only Accepting Today's Data
**Location:** `data_fetchers.py` line 645

**Problem:**
- App only used JSON file if date == today
- FII/DII data represents the **trading date**, not fetch date
- If fetched early in the day, it still shows yesterday's trading data
- On weekends/holidays, yesterday's data is the latest available

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# NEW CODE (IMPROVED)
if file_date == today or file_date == yesterday:
    # Accept both today's and yesterday's data
```

### Issue 3: Workflow Timing Confusion
**Location:** `.github/workflows/fetch_fii_dii.yml`

**Current Status:**
- Workflow scheduled for **13:00 UTC (6:30 PM IST)** ✅ Correct timing
- However, last run was at **02:36 UTC (8:06 AM IST)** - manually triggered
- NSE publishes FII/DII data **after market close (3:30 PM IST)**
- Running at 8 AM means it only gets previous day's data

**Current Data:**
```json
{
  "date": "29-Oct-2025",           // Trading date (Wednesday)
  "fetched_at": "2025-10-30 02:36:49 UTC"  // Fetched on Thursday morning
}
```

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Date Comparison (data_fetchers.py)
- Changed `datetime.now()` to `datetime.utcnow()`
- Now matches GitHub Actions timezone

### 2. Made Date Validation More Flexible
- Accept today's OR yesterday's data
- Shows label: "Today's" or "Yesterday's"
- More resilient to timing issues

### 3. Added Workflow Comments
- Clarified schedule timing
- Explained why 13:00 UTC is optimal

## 📊 Current Status

**JSON File:** Contains valid FII/DII data from Oct 29, 2025
```
FII Net: ₹-2,540.16 Cr (Sold)
DII Net: ₹5,692.81 Cr (Bought)
Source: NSE API
Date: 29-Oct-2025 (Last trading day)
```

**GitHub Actions:** ✅ Working
- Commits visible: Multiple "Update FII/DII data" commits
- Last run: Oct 30, 2025 at 02:36 UTC
- Schedule: Daily at 13:00 UTC (6:30 PM IST)

## 🧪 Testing

Run this to verify the fixes:
```bash
python3 test_fii_dii_date_check.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ File has YESTERDAY's data (UTC) - This is acceptable!
FII Net: ₹-2540.16 Cr
DII Net: ₹5692.81 Cr
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **App loads JSON file data** (fast, reliable)
2. **Accepts yesterday's data** if today's not available yet
3. **Shows source label:** "NSE API (File - Yesterday's)"
4. **Only fetches live** if data is >1 day old
5. **Fallback chain:** JSON → NSE API → MoneyControl → Cache → Placeholder

## 📅 Workflow Schedule

- **Scheduled time:** 13:00 UTC daily (6:30 PM IST)
- **Market close:** 3:30 PM IST
- **Data available:** ~4:00-5:00 PM IST
- **Workflow runs:** 6:30 PM IST ✅ After data is published

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Wait for next scheduled run** at 13:00 UTC today (6:30 PM IST)
2. **Verify workflow runs successfully** in GitHub Actions tab
3. **Check if Oct 30 data appears** (if today was a trading day and data is available)
4. **App should now display data correctly** without trying to fetch live

## 🔧 Manual Trigger (If Needed)

If you want fresh data now:
```bash
# Go to GitHub repo → Actions tab → Fetch FII/DII Data Daily → Run workflow
```

Or run locally:
```bash
cd /Users/krishnashukla/Desktop/NSE/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project
python3 fetch_fii_dii_daily.py
```

## ✨ Summary

**Root Cause:** Date comparison used local time instead of UTC, causing mismatch with GitHub Actions data.

**Impact:** App rejected JSON file data and tried to fetch live (which often fails on cloud).

**Resolution:** Fixed timezone comparison + made validation accept yesterday's data as fallback.

**Result:** App will now reliably show FII/DII data from JSON file without unnecessary live fetches.
